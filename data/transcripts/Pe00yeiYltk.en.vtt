00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.430 align:start position:0%
so one question you might ask yourself
is<00:09:39.760><c> if</c><00:09:39.920><c> you've</c><00:09:40.160><c> only</c><00:09:40.399><c> got</c><00:09:40.640><c> four</c><00:09:40.880><c> conductors</c>

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
is if you've only got four conductors
