everything I can to to make it work you
will<00:21:21.330><c> come</c><00:21:21.539><c> up</c><00:21:21.690><c> with</c><00:21:21.809><c> a</c><00:21:21.840><c> character</c><00:21:22.080><c> most</c>

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:22.470 align:start position:0%
will come up with a character most
 

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:25.130 align:start position:0%
will come up with a character most
likely<00:21:22.919><c> that's</c><00:21:23.159><c> you</c><00:21:24.090><c> know</c><00:21:24.179><c> pretty</c><00:21:24.390><c> effective</c>

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
likely that's you know pretty effective
 

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
likely that's you know pretty effective
in<00:21:25.260><c> play</c><00:21:25.530><c> and</c><00:21:25.830><c> so</c><00:21:26.070><c> it's</c><00:21:26.400><c> holds</c><00:21:26.730><c> the</c><00:21:26.789><c> same</c><00:21:26.940><c> for</c>

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:27.090 align:start position:0%
in play and so it's holds the same for
 

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:28.430 align:start position:0%
in play and so it's holds the same for
like<00:21:27.210><c> monks</c><00:21:27.480><c> and</c><00:21:27.570><c> rogues</c><00:21:27.780><c> that</c><00:21:27.990><c> are</c><00:21:28.140><c> too</c><00:21:28.289><c> boxy</c>

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:28.440 align:start position:0%

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.380 align:start position:0%
like monks and rogues that are too boxy
because<00:21:28.980><c> there's</c><00:21:29.280><c> so</c><00:21:29.580><c> much</c><00:21:29.730><c> synergy</c><00:21:30.240><c> there</c>

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:30.390 align:start position:0%
because there's so much synergy there
 

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:32.149 align:start position:0%
because there's so much synergy there

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:33.870 align:start position:0%
is one of those that that used to get
 

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
is one of those that that used to get
talked<00:21:34.169><c> about</c><00:21:34.320><c> a</c><00:21:34.350><c> lot</c><00:21:34.559><c> because</c><00:21:34.679><c> of</c><00:21:34.890><c> the</c><00:21:34.950><c> burst</c>

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:35.130 align:start position:0%
talked about a lot because of the burst
 

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:37.100 align:start position:0%
talked about a lot because of the burst

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:37.110 align:start position:0%
of speed of it but again I think it's an
 

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:39.110 align:start position:0%
of speed of it but again I think it's an
accurate<00:21:37.500><c> reflection</c><00:21:37.740><c> of</c><00:21:38.190><c> the</c><00:21:38.580><c> animal</c><00:21:39.030><c> that</c>

00:21:41.659 --> 00:21:41.669 align:start position:0%
it's based off of sure in quick bursts
 

00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:46.630 align:start position:0%
it's based off of sure in quick bursts

you get some sort of boost to climbing

you get some sort of boost to climbing
